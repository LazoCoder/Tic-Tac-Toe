 * Uses the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm to play a move in a game of Tic Tac Toe
 * but includes depth in the evaluation function.
 *
 * The vanilla MiniMax algorithm plays perfectly but it may occasionally
 * decide to make a move that will results in a slower victory or a faster loss.
 * For example, playing the move 0, 1, and then 7 gives the AI the opportunity
 * to play a move at index 6. This would result in a victory on the diagonal.
 * But the AI does not choose this move, instead it chooses another one. It
 * still wins inevitably, but it chooses a longer route. By adding the depth
 * into the evaluation function, it allows the AI to pick the move that would
 * make it win as soon as possible.
